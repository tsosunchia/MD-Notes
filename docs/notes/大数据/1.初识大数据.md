#### 什么是 Hadoop？

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

#### Hadoop 包含哪些 Modules？

The project includes these modules:

- **Hadoop Common**: The common utilities that support the other Hadoop modules.
- **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS™)**: A distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to application data.
- **Hadoop YARN**: A framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.
- **Hadoop MapReduce**: A YARN-based system for parallel processing of large data sets.
- **[Hadoop Ozone](https://hadoop.apache.org/ozone/)**: An object store for Hadoop.

#### 其他与 Hadoop 相关的项目（Related projects）

Other Hadoop-related projects at Apache include:

- [**Ambari™**](https://ambari.apache.org/): A web-based tool for provisioning, managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters which includes support for Hadoop HDFS, Hadoop MapReduce, Hive, HCatalog, HBase, ZooKeeper, Oozie, Pig and Sqoop. Ambari also provides a dashboard for viewing cluster health such as heatmaps and ability to view MapReduce, Pig and Hive applications visually alongwith features to diagnose their performance characteristics in a user-friendly manner.

- [**Tez™**](https://tez.apache.org/): A generalized data-flow programming framework, built on Hadoop YARN, which provides a powerful and flexible engine to execute an arbitrary DAG of tasks to process data for both batch and interactive use-cases. Tez is being adopted by Hive™, Pig™ and other frameworks in the Hadoop ecosystem, and also by other commercial software (e.g. ETL tools), to replace Hadoop™ MapReduce as the underlying execution engine.
- [**ZooKeeper™**](https://zookeeper.apache.org/): A high-performance coordination service for distributed applications.



##### HDFS文件系统

分布式文件系统那么多，为什么 hadoop 项目中还要开发一个 hdfs 文件系统？因为要支持分布式计算。
