### Question 1

1、True

信息安全的实际目标，是为了让破解未授权信息这种行为的成本高于信息本身的价值。

2、False

CBC 加密/解密过程，都是依赖前一个 block，并不是依赖 all preceding cipher blocks.

参考：ctf wiki https://ctf-wiki.org/crypto/blockcipher/mode/cbc/?h=cbc

3、False

数字签名依赖于非对称密码（本题说的对称加密），因为我们必须确保一方能够做的事情，而另一方不能够做出这样的事情。

参考：ctf wiki https://ctf-wiki.org/crypto/signature/introduction/

4、False

对称加密的数字签名，例如 RSA 数字签名：私钥加密（本题说的公钥加密），公钥解密

参考：ctf wiki https://ctf-wiki.org/crypto/signature/rsa/

5、True

参考：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)

Kerberos builds on [symmetric-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_cryptography) and requires a [trusted third party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_third_party), and optionally may use [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) during certain phases of authentication.

6、False

加密算法是可以公开的

7、True

Access Control Matrix，不确定

8、False

Encryption is applied three times to a message with three keys, not a single key of three times in length. 

参考：ctf wiki https://ctf-wiki.org/crypto/blockcipher/des/?h=des#des_2

9、True

**Single sign-on** (**SSO**) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to [log in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login) with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.

参考：PPT & https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on

10、True

私钥加密，公钥解密（加解密）与 公钥加密，私钥解密（数字签名）都可以得到正确的明文

参考：ctf wiki https://ctf-wiki.org/crypto/asymmetric/rsa/rsa_theory/

11、True

对于*强制访问控制*机制，有多种模型可以用来描述其功能，其中最具代表性的就是Bell-LaPadula模型(简称*BLP*模型)及Biba模型

12、True

重放攻击

Replay attacks can be prevented by tagging each [encrypted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) component with a [session ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_ID) and a component number.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack#cite_note-:0-2) This combination of solutions does not use anything that is interdependent on one another. Due to the fact that there is no interdependency, there are fewer vulnerabilities. This works because a unique, random session ID is created for each run of the program; thus, a previous run becomes more difficult to replicate. In this case, an attacker would be unable to perform the replay because on a new run the session ID would have changed.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack#cite_note-:0-2)

13、True

存密码hash，即使服务器被攻击，也不会泄露用户密码

14、True

CA中心为每个使用[公开密钥](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/公开密钥)的用户发放一个[数字证书](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/数字证书)，数字证书的作用是证明证书中列出的用户合法拥有证书中列出的公开密钥。

参考：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority

15、True

### Question 2

1、参考：https://online.maryville.edu/blog/three-cyber-security-issues-organizations-face/

##### Unprecedented Attacks

The amount of valuable information that resides on multiple data sources has grown exponentially from the early days of a single computer. The opportunity for organizations of all sizes to have their data compromised grows as the number of devices that store confidential data increases. Internet of Things (IoT), borne of all these devices, has lent itself well to creating an unprecedented attack surface security professionals never had to deal with in the past. Business owners must make security plans with this attack surface in mind, and not think only about their business computers and mobile devices.

##### Cyber Espionage

Both large and small organizations are beginning to store at least some of their data in the cloud. Right Scale recently found that private cloud adoption increased to 77% among organizations; hybrid cloud computing increased as well. Whether the thief is coming from the inside or outside, attacking private, public or hybrid cloud technologies, trade secrets and other valuable intellectual properties are at risk. This is, of course, in addition to valuable customer data.

It’s important for business owners to be aware of cloud technology best practices and regulations surrounding sensitive data. Setting the cloud up securely is important, and monitoring it is key. After all, the same Right Scale survey found that security is no longer the number one concern regarding the cloud; it has been supplanted by the lack of expertise and resources in the area.

##### Data Theft

According to the SEC, “small and midsize businesses (“SMBs”)] are not just targets of cybercrime, they are its principal target. In fact, the majority of all targeted cyberattacks last year were directed at SMBs.” Many criminals target these businesses as “gateways” into larger ones, as small businesses usually don’t have the large and robust security protocols in place that prevent theft. The SEC refers to, as an example, the Target breach that occurred as a result of an initial cyber attack on a small business that serviced the organization’s heating and air conditioning. Customer data was stolen in a breach that touched both a small and a large organization.

The SEC also notes that small businesses face similar data security threats as large organizations do, but must confront them with fewer resources and less expertise. A staggering 83% of the time, the owners of small businesses handle threats on their own. One survey highlighted by the SEC notes that only 29% of small businesses know what they need to do to improve security measures; another study found that companies making less than $100 million have reduced their spending on cyber security even in the face of increasing incidents.

Clearly, vulnerabilities abound for both large and small businesses in a new age of cyber security threats. Understanding a hacker’s methodology can help mitigate the imminent threat of having data stolen. By staying ahead of the game when it comes to cyber security, you can prevent the massive damage that results from large-scale data breaches.

2、为什么非对称加密比对称加密慢？参考：https://juejin.cn/post/6855129005688340494

AES：https://ctf-wiki.org/crypto/blockcipher/aes/，对称加密算法，块加密

RSA：https://ctf-wiki.org/crypto/asymmetric/rsa/rsa_theory/，非对称加密算法

3、message digest，数字摘要

参考：https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4024/message-digest

A message digest is a cryptographic hash function containing a string of digits created by a one-way hashing formula.

Message digests are designed to protect the integrity of a piece of data or media to detect changes and alterations to any part of a message. They are a type of cryptography utilizing hash values that can warn the copyright owner of any modifications applied to their work.

Message digest hash numbers represent specific files containing the protected works. One message digest is assigned to particular data content. It can reference a change made deliberately or accidentally, but it prompts the owner to identify the modification as well as the individual(s) making the change. Message digests are algorithmic numbers.

This term is also known as a hash value and sometimes as a **checksum**.

**MD5, SHA and CRC32** are message digest algorithms.

哈希函数（Hash Function）把消息或数据压缩成摘要，使得数据量变小。

~~不知道如何解释“why message digest reduce the computational overhead for the authentation of messages”，一定要问的话，首先其他方式的authentation of messages是如何实现的？对称/非对称加密吗？大多数加密方式需要进行迭代运算吧，而数字摘要只需要一次运算，而且它是一个 one-way function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function), that is, a function for which it is practically infeasible to invert or reverse the computation.~~

> 作者：编程指北

一般而言，我们不会直接对数据本身直接计算数字签名，为什么呢？因为数字签名属于非对称加密，非对称加密依赖于复杂的数学运算，包括大数乘法、大数模等等，耗时比较久。如果数据量大的时候计算数字签名将会比较耗时，所以一般做法是先将原数据进行 Hash 运算，得到的 Hash 值就叫做「摘要」。「摘要」就像人的指纹一样，可以代表一个人，只要内容发生了改变，计算出来的摘要也应该变化。

4、没太看懂

参考：https://sites.google.com/site/cacsolin/bell-lapadula

The Bell-La Padula (BLP) model is a model of computer security that focuses on [mandatory](https://sites.google.com/site/cacsolin/mandatory-access-control) and [discretionary access control](https://sites.google.com/site/cacsolin/discretionary-access-control). It was spelled out in an influential paper by David E Bell and Leonard J. La Padula.

- Read Down: A mandatory access control scheme is where one trusted user/process (usually the system administrator or perhaps the operating system itself) creates and enforces the rules for access control. A discretionary access control scheme is one where the owner of a file can manipulate the access control permissions to their desire.

- Write Up: "a subject at a given security level must not write to any object at a lower security level." In other words, you can only create documents of an equal or higher level security than your access level.

5、应该是说一下数字证书的原理

How do trust certificates work?

The chain of trust of a certificate chain is an ordered list of certificates, containing an end-user subscriber certificate and intermediate certificates (that represents the intermediate CA), that enables the receiver to verify that the sender and all intermediate certificates are trustworthy.

> 参考：https://www.zhihu.com/question/52493697/answer/1600962734

##### 3.6 数字证书

为了解决这个问题，就引入了「数字证书」，什么叫数字证书呢？

百度百科：

>  数字证书是指在互联网通讯中标志通讯各方身份信息的一个数字认证，人们可以在网上用它来识别对方的身份。
>  因此数字证书又称为数字标识。数字证书对网络用户在交流中的信息和数据等以加密或解密的形式保证了信息和数据的完整性和安全性。
>  

看了这个描述，是不是感觉还是云里雾里，还是我用大白话来说吧~

**只要你理解了前面的数字签名，就能理解这里的数字证书，因为我把数字证书叫做「公钥的数字签名」。**

为什么呢？我们引入数字证书的目的是为了保证公钥不被篡改，即使被篡改了也能识别出来。

而防篡改的方法就是数字签名，但是这个签名不能我们自己做，原因说过了，因为我们的公钥还没分发出去，别人无法验证。

所以只能找可信的第三方来帮我们签名，即证书颁布机构（CA），CA 会将：证书的颁布机构、有效期、公钥、持有者(subject)等信息用 CA 的私钥进行签名。

并且将签名结果和这些信息放在一起，这就叫做「数字证书」。

6、最小特权原则是什么？它有哪些时间和空间要求？

个人理解：不被允许的都是禁止的

The principle of least privilege (POLP) is a **concept in computer security that limits users' access rights to only what are strictly required to do their jobs**. Users are granted permission to read, write or execute only the files or resources necessary to do their jobs.

它有哪些时间和空间要求？linux 权限管理随便举个例子吧

### Question 3

1、为什么公钥密码学（非对称式密码学）可以验证信息的发送者？

前面这篇 https://www.zhihu.com/question/52493697/answer/1600962734 讲过了

2、因为 secret key 可能被中间人截获。如果密钥泄露，被中间人截获，那么就等同于明文通信。

前面这篇 https://www.zhihu.com/question/52493697/answer/1600962734 讲过了

### Question 4

ACL，看描述就行了，略

### Question 5

1、SSO 实现了什么？

**Single sign-on** (**SSO**) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to [log in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login) with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.
