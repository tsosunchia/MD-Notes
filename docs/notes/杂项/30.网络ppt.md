### Classification of Cryptography

Secret key cryptography: DES, Triple-DES, AES

- symmetric cryptography
- A single key (one shared key) is used for both encryption and decryption

Public key cryptography

- Asymmetric cryptography
- A pair of keys (private key, public key) are used for encryption and decryption
